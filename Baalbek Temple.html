						<dd>
							<p>
								The Temple of Bacchus, located in the ancient city of Baalbek,
								Lebanon, is one of the most magnificent and well-preserved Roman
								temples in the world. Constructed around AD 150 during the reign
								of Emperor Antoninus Pius, it is part of the larger Baalbek
								temple complex, which also includes the iconic Temple of
								Jupiter. The temple was dedicated to Bacchus, the Roman god of
								wine, fertility, and celebration, reflecting the cultural and
								religious significance of Bacchus worship in Roman society.

								Measuring approximately 66 meters long and 35 meters wide, the
								Temple of Bacchus originally featured 42 towering Corinthian
								columns, each over 19 meters in height, some of which still
								stand today, creating an awe-inspiring sight for visitors. The
								temple’s exterior and interior are adorned with intricately
								carved reliefs, friezes, and cornices, depicting grapevines,
								mythological scenes, and symbolic motifs celebrating Bacchus and
								Roman religious beliefs. Its large cella, or inner sanctuary,
								remains remarkably intact, offering a glimpse into the grandeur
								of ancient Roman temple design and ceremonial space.

								The temple’s construction demonstrates extraordinary Roman
								engineering and architectural skill, with massive limestone
								blocks carefully cut and assembled without modern machinery. Its
								survival through centuries of earthquakes, natural erosion, and
								human activity is a testament to the precision and durability of
								Roman craftsmanship. The Temple of Bacchus, along with the
								surrounding Baalbek complex, is recognized as a UNESCO World
								Heritage Site, highlighting its historical, cultural, and
								archaeological importance.
							</p>

							<p>
								Today, the temple draws scholars, archaeologists, and tourists
								from around the world who come to study its architecture and to
								experience the grandeur of Roman civilization in the Middle
								East. It remains a powerful symbol of ancient religious
								devotion, artistic achievement, and imperial influence, standing
								as a remarkable link between the past and present in Lebanon’s
								rich cultural landscape.
