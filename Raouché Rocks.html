                    <dd><p>Raouché Rocks, commonly known as the Pigeon Rocks, are among the most iconic natural landmarks in Beirut, Lebanon. Rising dramatically from the Mediterranean Sea, these two massive limestone formations are located off the coast of the Raouché district, at the western edge of the city. Their striking shape and towering height make them one of the most photographed sites in Lebanon and a symbol of Beirut’s coastal beauty.</p></dd>
                    <dd><p>>Geologists believe the rocks were formed thousands of years ago, likely as a result of a powerful earthquake that caused part of the coastline to collapse. Over centuries, waves and winds sculpted the formations into the majestic arches and cliffs seen today. This natural erosion process continues to shape the rocks, giving them their unique appearance.</p></dd>
                    <dd><p>Beyond their geological significance, Raouché Rocks are deeply connected to Lebanese culture. The surrounding Corniche has long been a popular gathering place where locals and tourists enjoy walks, sunsets, and the refreshing sea breeze. Boat tours allow visitors to approach the rocks up close, offering a stunning view of their natural arch. As a whole, Raouché Rocks represent the harmony between nature, history, and daily life in Beirut.</p></dd>
