                    <dd><p>The Statue of Liberty is one of the most famous monuments in the world and a powerful symbol of freedom and democracy. Located on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, the statue was a gift from the people of France to the United States to celebrate the centennial of American independence and the friendship between the two nations. It was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, with its internal structure engineered by Gustave Eiffel.</p></dd>
                    <dd><p>Construction of the statue began in France in the early 1880s, and the completed parts were shipped to the United States, where the statue was assembled on a pedestal. It was officially dedicated on October 28, 1886. The statue represents Libertas, the Roman goddess of liberty, holding a torch in her right hand and a tablet in her left, inscribed with the date of American independence, July 4, 1776.</p></dd>
                    <dd><p>Over the years, the Statue of Liberty has welcomed millions of immigrants arriving by sea, becoming a symbol of hope and new beginnings. Today, it remains one of America’s most important cultural landmarks and a popular tourist attraction.</p></dd>
