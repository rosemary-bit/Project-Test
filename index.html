					Touristic Monuments in Lebanon Lebanon is home to several remarkable
					touristic monuments that combine natural beauty with deep historical
					roots. The Raouché Rocks, also known as the Pigeon Rocks, form one of
					Beirut’s most famous coastal landmarks. These massive rock formations
					rise dramatically from the Mediterranean Sea and attract visitors who
					come to enjoy the view, take photos, or walk along the nearby seaside
					corniche. In the Beqaa Valley, the Baalbek Temple complex stands as
					one of the most impressive ancient sites in the Middle East. With
					gigantic stone columns and remarkably preserved Roman architecture,
					Baalbek reflects Lebanon’s rich past and its importance during the
					Roman Empire. Together, these monuments highlight Lebanon’s mix of
					natural wonders and ancient history, making the country a unique and
					unforgettable destination for travelers.
